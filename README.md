# Gym Management System

#### A Gym Management System built to simplify the management of membership and member data.

The app facilitates the convenient storage and accessibility of gym receipts online. The admin can manage memberships, track member status, register new members, update and delete accounts, send personalised messages, and publish holidays. Members can access their current membership status and receipt history, as well as an online supplement store and details of their prescribed diet regimen.

## üöß Future Enhancements

#### 1. Supplement Store

The products in the store come from a JSON file. The store can be made fully functional by creating a collection for the store in Firestore, where the admin can create and store products in the store. A product's image can be stored in the Firebase Storage.

#### 2. Diets

The same applies to the diets section; the diets data also comes from a JSON file. The admin can have the facility to add, remove, or update diet information in the diets section.

#### 3. Personal Trainer

A feature to assign personal trainers to members throughout their membership period.
